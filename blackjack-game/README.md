# Using Blackjack to learn Javascript

## What I learned making this app

- **Arrays.** Defined cards array, used .push to push newcard to array

- **Objects.** Player object and chip ammount.

- **Booleans**. isAlive and hasBlackJack variables to determine whether player has won, lost or can take another card.

- **If else statements.** To wrap the statements in and house the game.

- **Comparison operators.** To add rules for the if else statements.

- **Logical operators.** E.g. to check if player isAlive === true && hasBlackJack === false, so the player can take a new card.

- **For loops.** E.g. rendering the cards. (will need to practise this one a bit more to become comfrotable with it, lol.)

- **The Math Object.** Math.random and Math.floor.

- **Return statements.** Returning values in functions.
